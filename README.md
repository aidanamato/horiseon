# 1. HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

For this project I completed the task of refactoring a starting HTML and CSS sheet so that it meets modern accessibility standards, eliminates unnecessary code, and contains appropriate comments throughout. In order to do do this, I:
    1. Added a "title" element that succinctly describes the page.
    2. Updated the HTML elements to include accessible semantic elements.
    3. Restructured the HTML elements to create a more logical, streamlined structure.
    4. Added "alt" classes to all "img" tags to increase accessibility.
    5. Added thorough commenting throughout both documents.

## Deployment
